      <ol>
        <li>
          The server serves and sends the client requested information if the
          client has the required access
        </li>
        <li>The client requests information from the server</li>
        <li>
          An IP(Internet Protocol) address is a unique identifier and
          destination assigned to computers
        </li>
        <li>
          DNS stands for Domain Name System and it effectively is a phonebook
          (which can be thought of like a key:value database) connecting human
          readable Domain Names like "www.google.com" to unreadable IP addresses
          like "192.0.2.1"
        </li>
        <li>
          The Internet refers to the system of interconnected computers that
          utilizes TCP/IP to communicate between devices and networks. WWW(World
          Wide Web) refers to the Web which is an information system on top of
          the internet that lets web resources be accessed over the Internet
          using HTTP.
        </li>
        <li>
          HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and it is a text format used
          by the web to give structure and content to a web page
        </li>
        <li>
          CSS files are kept inside the head element and not the body since CSS
          is styling information about the body, not the body itself, which
          contain the visual elements of a web page
        </li>
        <li>
          Inline styles override rules defined in style elements and external
          stylesheets because inline styles are of a higher specificity than the
          previously mentioned methods. In addition, inline styles are computed
          last and the lastly computed code takes precedence over earlier code
        </li>
