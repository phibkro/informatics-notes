# Agile development methodology

## Agile manifesto

Prioritize:

- **people and interactions** over _processes and tools_
- **working software** over _comprehensive documentation_
- **customer collaboration** over _contract negotiation_ (?)
- **responding to change** over _following a plan_

This does not mean disregard the items on the right.
This means value the left items over the right.

These _agile principles_ were made concrete through the _agile manifesto_

“In a lot of ways, the Manifesto is a basis of a conversation,” Wortham said. “Here’s how I interpret it. How do you interpret it? All right, let’s figure out how to work together.”
