## CPU core architecture

CPU optimization

- Super-scalar (multiple alu's)
- Out-of-order execution
- Branch prediction
- Speculative execution
- Speculative memory access

## GPU core architecture

Uses API as communication layer between CPU and GPU

No "optimization" features needed because of all the threads.

## GPU Shader core
